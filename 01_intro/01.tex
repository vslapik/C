% 0. Intro
% 1. What the course is about
%    - new features (c89,c99,c11)
%    - the course is rather about how not to write instead of how to write
%    - traps/common mistakes, etc.
% 2. Why English
% 3. Linux, only Linux
% 4. Audience: refresh/deepen knowledge, a bit challanging for newcomers
% 5. Strongly suggest implementing practical task
% 6. Timetable (10 lectures + 1 lecture for practice analyze) around 1:40 each

        \pause \item Provide only one way to do an operation.
        \pause \item Make it fast, even if it is not guaranteed to be portable.

% It is very common for people to say — or at least think — something like this:
%
% The x86 ADD instruction is used to implement C’s signed add operation, and it
% has two’s complement behavior when the result overflows. I’m developing for
% an x86 platform, so I should be able to expect two’s complement semantics when
% 32-bit signed integers overflow.
%
% THIS IS WRONG. You are saying something like this:
%
% Somebody once told me that in basketball you can’t hold the ball and run.
% I got a basketball and tried it and it worked just fine. He obviously ddn’t
% understand basketball.
