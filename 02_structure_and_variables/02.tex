    The constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.

        \item using \textbf{enum} keyword
        \lstinputlisting{02_const_enum.c}
        %enums are signed (compatible with int). In any context where an unsigned type is required (think especially bitwise operations!), enums are out.
        %if long long is wider than int, big constants won't fit in an enum.
        %The size of an enum is sizeof(int). For arrays of small values (up to say, CHAR_MAX) you might want a char foo[] rather than an enum foo[] array.
        %enums are integral numbers. You can't have enum funny_number { 3.14, 2.71 }.
        %enums are a C89 feature; K&R compilers (admittedly ancient) don't understand them.
