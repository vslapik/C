        Integer types smaller than int are promoted when an operation is

        an int; otherwise, it is converted to an unsigned int. Integer
        promotions are applied as part of the usual arithmetic conversions
        to certain argument expressions; operands of the unary \texttt{+},
        \texttt{-}, and \textasciitilde{} operators; and operands of
        the shift operators.

%If both operands have the same type, then no further conversion is needed.

%Otherwise, if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned integer types, the operand with the type of lesser integer conversion rank is converted to the type of the operand with greater rank.
%
%Otherwise, if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand, then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type.
%
%Otherwise, if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type, then the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the operand with signed integer type.
%
%Otherwise, both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type.
