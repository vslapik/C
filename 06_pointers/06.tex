\begin{frame}{Pointer arithmetic}
    \only<1>{
        There are several arithmetic operations defined on pointers to data:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item adding an integer to a pointer
            \item substracting an integer from a pointer
            \item substructing two pointers from each other
            \item comparing pointers
        \end{itemize}

        A pointer to \kwblue{void} (\kwblue{void *}) is a general-purpose pointer used to hold references to any data type.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item you can't perform integer arithmetic on \kwblue{void *}
            \item you can't dereference \kwblue{void *}
            \item you can assign a void pointer to any data type pointer without explicit cast
            \item \kwblue{void *} have the same representation and memory alignment as a pointer to \kwblue{char}
        \end{itemize}

        \justifying
        Below is the canonical example of an abstract data type (ADT) implementation for stack structure. \kwblack{stack\_t} is an \textcolor{blue}{opaque pointer}.

    \justifying
    \textcolor{blue}{opaque pointer} is a special case of an opaque data type, a datatype declared to be a pointer to a record or data structure of some unspecified type.

\begin{frame}{Null pointer}
    \only<1>{
        \justify
        For each pointer type, there is a special value \- the "null pointer" \- which is distinguishable from all other pointer values and which is "guaranteed to compare unequal to a pointer to any object or function". In other words "null pointer"\: is not the address of any object or function.
    }
    \only<2>{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item null pointer has value called null pointer constant - integer constant expression with value 0 (or (\kwblue{void} *)0)
            \item \hdr{stddef.h} usually has a definition to represent the null pointer constant such as \texttt{\kwblue{\#define} NULL ((\kwblue{void} *)0)}
            \item \justifying an initialization, assignment, or comparison when one side is a variable or expression of pointer type, the compiler can tell that a constant 0 on the other side requests a null pointer, and generate the correctly-typed null pointer value
            \item the actual internal representation of null pointers is implementation-defined; NULL and 0 are language-level symbols that represent a null pointer
            \item dereferencing of a null pointer leads to \textcolor{red}{undefined behaviour}
