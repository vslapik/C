\begin{frame}{Operations on structures}
    \only<1>{
        There are several operations defined on structures:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item assign a structure to another structure
            \item pass a structure to a function
            \item return a structure from a function
        \end{itemize}
        \vskip 20pt
        A few more points to mention:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item you can treat an array as a first-class type if put it inside a structure
            \item in general you have to write your own function to compare structures
        \end{itemize}

        Can a compiler rearrange the members inside a structure in order to avoid padding? The answer is "No".
        \begin{block}{C11 \textsection{6.7.2.15}}
            Within a structure object, the non-bit-field members and the units in which bit-fields
            reside have addresses that increase in the order in which they are declared.

            \item the total number of bits in a single bit field must not exceed the total number of bits in its declared type

            \item \kwblue{sizeof} operator may not be applied to bit fields
            \item it is not allowed to define an array of bit fields

\begin{frame}{Tagged unions}
    \only<1>{
In computer science, a \kwblue{tagged union}, also called a variant, variant record, choice type, discriminated union, disjoint union, sum type or coproduct, is a data structure used to hold a value that could take on several different, but fixed, types. Only one of the types can be in use at any one time, and a tag field explicitly indicates which one is in use.

    \only<2>{
In computer science, \kwblue{type punning} is a common term for any programming technique that subverts or circumvents the type system of a programming language in order to achieve an effect that would be difficult or impossible to achieve within the bounds of the formal language.
    }
    \only<3>{
        \begin{block}{C11 \textsection{6.5.2.3}}
If the member used to read the contents of a union object is not the same as the member last used to
store a value in the object, the appropriate part of the object representation of the value is reinterpreted
as an object representation in the new type as described in 6.2.6 (a process sometimes called "type
punning")
