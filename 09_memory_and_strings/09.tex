%TODO: algorithm Shmaela http://timurv.livejournal.com/32560.html strcat
%TODO: mention mempools concept and talloc library
%TODO: provide alternative to gets getwd
%TODO: tell about strncpy and it's odd behaviour and why it not replacement for strcpy (UNIX directory entry)

%TODO: functions to afraid and avoid: strcpy, strcat, sprintf (vsprintf)
%TODO: realloc(x, 0), realloc(0, x)
%TODO: memory functions
%TODO: don't p = realloc(p, n) because you lose pointer value if mem allocation failed

%TODO: strchr problem (const correctness)

            \justifying
            If the size of the space requested is zero, the behavior is implementation defined:
            either a null pointer is returned, or the behavior is as if the size
            were some nonzero value, except that the returned pointer shall not be
            used to access an object.

        \begin{block}{C11 \textsection{7.22.3.3}}
            \justifying
            The free function causes the space pointed to by ptr to be deallocated, that is, made
            available for further allocation. If ptr is a null pointer, no action occurs.

            the malloc function for the specified size.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item gets() (removed in C11), use fgets() instead
        \item getwd() (POSIX, marked as obsolete), use getcwd() instead
        \item strcpy() and strcat() are potentially unsafe, strlcpy() or strlcat() may be an alternative
        \item sprintf() should be avoided, either snprintf() (C99) or asprintf() (GNU)
